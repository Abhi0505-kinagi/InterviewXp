# 🧩 Project Name

This project is a web-based application built to understand and implement real-world social platform features such as posts, likes, comments, and user interaction.  
The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with full application flow, state management, and feature integration rather than just building isolated components.

The project focuses on functionality first and is being improved incrementally.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built this project to:
- Practice building a complete, working application instead of small demos
- Understand how user interactions like likes and comments work internally
- Learn how frontend components interact with backend logic and data
- Get experience managing features, edge cases, and future scalability

This project helped me think like a real developer by planning features, implementing them step by step, and improving them over time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users can create and view posts on the platform
- Each post supports likes and comments
- Users can interact anonymously
- Post views are tracked when a post is opened
- The application dynamically updates the UI based on user actions

The core functionality is implemented first, and additional layers such as security and advanced search are planned to be added later.
